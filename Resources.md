*Competitive Coding*ðŸ’» _is not just a subject it's a sport which you can't master only with theory, it requires a lot of problem solving practice._

*Many people think that it's only for people with high IQ*ðŸ˜µ *, But trust me it is not the case*ðŸ˜„ _. Anyone can do well with competitive coding provided his/her concepts on data structures and algorithms are strong._

## Here are some resources which could help be a better programmer.

#### MyCodeSchool is a really great channel for understanding theory of programming, It covers various concepts on DSA and time complexity.

#### Clever Programmer is suggested if you are a developer and would like to same some project in React or Python.

#### Some Great theory out there on hackerearth these notes could be used as a reference for beginners or for revision at later stages.

**[hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/)**

<hr>

#### Should participate in Codeforces contests and try to improve ratings.Practice problems are quite good on this platform and should be practiced in order from low difficulty to higher difficulty.

**[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)**

#### Atcoder and Spoj are some great sites to practice problems and test your theory.

<hr>

#### From Theory to Problems leetcode is there to help you with everything.

**[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)**

<hr>

#### One of the best books For clearing programming interviews, Suggested at little later stages when you get your hands good at problem solving and interviews are approaching.

**[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.in/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/dp/0984782869/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1603566768&sr=8-2)**

There are normally Two approaches out there !
<br>
1)Practice and Learn<br>
2)Learn and Practice<br>

## You have to figure out what best suits you and follow that approach.

Happy Programming!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
